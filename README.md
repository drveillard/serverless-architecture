# Serverless Architecture

## What is serverless?
Serverless allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. It eliminates infrastructure management tasks such as server or cluster provisioning, patching, operating system maintenance, and capacity provisioning. You can build them for nearly any type of application or backend service, and everything required to run and scale your application with high availability is handled for you.

 - Serverless applications are event-driven and loosely coupled via technology-agnostic APIs or messaging. 
 - Event-driven code is executed in response to an event, such as a change in state or an endpoint request. 
 - Event-driven architectures decouple code from state. Integration between loosely couple components is usually done asynchronously, with messaging.


## Why use serverless?
- **No server management:** - There is no need to provision or maintain any servers. There is no software or runtime to install, maintain, or administer.

- **Flexible scaling:** - Your application can be scaled automatically or by adjusting its capacity through toggling the units of consumption (e.g. throughput, memory) rather than units of individual servers.

- **Pay for value:** - Pay for consistent throughput or execution duration rather than by server unit.

- **Automated high availability:** - Serverless provides built-in availability and fault tolerance. You don't need to architect for these capabilities since the services running the application provide them by default.
