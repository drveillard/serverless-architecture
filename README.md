# Serverless Architecture

## What is serverless?
Serverless allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. It eliminates infrastructure management tasks such as server or cluster provisioning, patching, operating system maintenance, and capacity provisioning. You can build them for nearly any type of application or backend service, and everything required to run and scale your application with high availability is handled for you.

 - Serverless applications are event-driven and loosely coupled via technology-agnostic APIs or messaging. 
 - Event-driven code is executed in response to an event, such as a change in state or an endpoint request. 
 - Event-driven architectures decouple code from state. Integration between loosely couple components is usually done asynchronously, with messaging.
